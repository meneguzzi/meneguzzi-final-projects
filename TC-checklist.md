# Checklist for final year projects

The following checklist applies to both Computer Science (Ciência da Computação) and Information Systems (Sistemas de Informação). Do not forget to read my [tips on writing good science](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/writing.shtml).

## Final project proposal

- [ ] Abstract: the abstract must answer the following questions
	- [ ] What is the problem your project aims to address?
	- [ ] Why is this problem interesting?
	- [ ] How do you aim to solve the problem?
	- [ ] What follows from your solution?
- [ ] Table of Contents
- [ ] Introduction: check the introduction 
	- [ ] Avoid jargon <br/> Do you avoid jargon that is only explain in the rest of the text?
	- [ ] Clarity <br/> Can anyone from computer science read the introduction and understand what's the objective?
	- [ ] Does it clearly describe the problem?
	- [ ] Does the introduction clearly state the contributions?
- [ ] Literature Review: the literature review is meant to convey your knowledge of the subject matter of the proposal, so check for
	- [ ] Does it provide basic definitions of the area?
	- [ ] Terminology dropping from the sky <br/> new technical terms must be explained before they are used, avoid talk about a deteronic frombotzer if you have not said what this is
	- [ ] Consistency of terminology  <br/> do not you different terms to refer to the same technical entity, once you define something as X always refer to it as X
	- [ ] Are the references up to date <br/> i.e. do you cite work that was published in the last 5-10 years
- [ ] Objectives: this is the objective of your design, it will generally focus on studying something to plan for its implementation
	- [ ] General objective <br/> i.e. a brief statement of what it is you want to accomplish
	- [ ] Specific objectives <br/> i.e. a list of concrete goals (you can think of them as 'deliverables')
- [ ] Work plan: 
	- [ ] Real timeline <br/> Does it contain work for all months of the work? Do not count the month you wrote this.
	- [ ] Realistic plan <br/> Avoid doing too many actions in the same month
	- [ ] Achievable plan <br/> You must be able to deliver what you said you would
	- [ ] Avoid copying specific objectives <br/> but the work to reach them can drive this timeline
- [ ] Bibliography: check the bibliography for the following items
	- [ ] Are all references rendering correctly with BibTex (check for foreign language characters and odd symbols)?
	- [ ] Are all references correct? Remember DBLP, ACM, Google Scholar and other automated databases **do** contain errors
	- [ ] Are any important references missing?
	
## Final project I (Project Design)

The text you deliver at the end of TC1 is a much expanded version of your plan, and must culminate in

- [ ] Abstract: the abstract must answer the following questions
	- [ ] What is the problem your project aims to address?
	- [ ] Why is this problem interesting?
	- [ ] How do you aim to solve the problem?
	- [ ] What follows from your solution?
- [ ] Table of Contents
- [ ] Glossary/Abbreviations (if your work is acronym heavy)
- [ ] Introduction: check the introduction 
	- [ ] Avoid jargon <br/> Do you avoid jargon that is only explain in the rest of the text?
	- [ ] Clarity <br/> Can anyone from computer science read the introduction and understand what's the objective?
	- [ ] Does it clearly describe the problem?
	- [ ] Does the introduction clearly state the contributions?
- [ ] Literature Review Chapters: are meant to convey your knowledge of the subject matter of the proposal, so check for
	- [ ] Is the literature review substantially improved from the proposal?
	- [ ] Balanced chapters/sections <br/> the review chapter can be divided into multiple chapters, make sure subjects are well balanced in the chapters
	- [ ] Basic definitions <br/> Does it provide basic definitions of the area?
	- [ ] Terminology dropping from the sky <br/> new technical terms must be explained before they are used, avoid talk about a deteronic frombotzer if you have not said what this is
	- [ ] Consistency of terminology  <br/> do not you different terms to refer to the same technical entity, once you define something as X always refer to it as X
	- [ ] Are the references up to date <br/> i.e. do you cite work that was published in the last 5-10 years? It's Ok to cite older work, but if you only do this, everyone will question the novelty of your topic
- [ ] Objectives: now you should know your stuff, so you must be clear about what is it that you will deliver at the end of the next semester
	- [ ] Overall objective <br/> i.e. a brief statement of what it is you want to **deliver**
	- [ ] Specific objectives <br/> i.e. a list of concrete goals as you move towards your overall objective, these are now 'deliverables'

## Final project II (Project Implementation)
