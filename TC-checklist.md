# Checklist for final year projects

The following checklist applies to both Computer Science (Ciência da Computação) and Information Systems (Sistemas de Informação)

## Final project proposal

- [ ] Abstract: the abstract must answer the following questions
	- [ ] What is the problem your project aims to address?
	- [ ] Why is this problem interesting?
	- [ ] How do you aim to solve the problem?
	- [ ] What follows from your solution?
- [ ] Table of Contents
- [ ] Introduction: check the introduction 
	- [ ] Avoid jargon <br/> Do you avoid jargon that is only explain in the rest of the text?
	- [ ] Clarity <br/> Can anyone from computer science read the introduction and understand what's the objective?
	- [ ] Does it clearly describe the problem?
	- [ ] Does the introduction clearly state the contributions?
- [ ] Literature Review: the introduction is meant to convey your knowledge of the subject matter of the proposal, so check for
	- [ ] Does it provide basic definitions of the area?
	- [ ] Are the references up to date <br/> i.e. do you cite work that was published in the last 5-10 years
- [ ] Objectives
	- [ ] General objective <br/> i.e. a brief statement of what it is you want to accomplish
	- [ ] Specific objectives <br/> i.e. a list of concrete goals (you can think of them as 'deliverables')
- [ ] Work plan
	- [ ] Real timeline <br/> Does it contain work for all months of the work? Do not count the month you wrote this.
	- [ ] Realistic plan <br/> Avoid doing too many actions in the same month
	- [ ] Avoid copying specific objectives <br/> but the work to reach them can drive this timeline
- [ ] Bibliography: check the bibliography for the following items
	- [ ] Are all references rendering correctly with BibTex (check for foreign language characters and odd symbols)?
	- [ ] Are all references correct? Remember DBLP, ACM, Google Scholar and other automated databases **do** contain errors
	- [ ] Are any important references missing?
