# Final Year Project Ideas
Ideas for final year projects that I'd be keen to advise

- Implementing a new AI system for the [Battle for Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org) game.
   * Using reinforcement learning
   * Connecting it to an AgentSpeak(L) interpreter like [Jason](http://jason.sf.net)
   * Using some kind of automated planner
- Reimplementing the core of the [Jason](http://jason.sf.net) interpreter using a micro-kernel architecture that allows network-based debugging
