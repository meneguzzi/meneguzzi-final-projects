# Final Year Project Ideas
Ideas for final year projects that I'd be keen to advise

- Implementing a new AI system for the [Battle for Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org) game, they seem to have a [tutorial for customising the AI](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Customizing_AI_in_Wesnoth_1.8) (hopefully better than the one from a few years ago).
   * Using reinforcement learning
   * Connecting it to an AgentSpeak(L) interpreter like [Jason](http://jason.sf.net)
   * Using some kind of automated planner
- Reimplementing the core of the [Jason](http://jason.sf.net) interpreter using a micro-kernel architecture that allows network-based debugging
